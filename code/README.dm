/*
This game is an attempt to recreate a tabletop like environment for use in roleplaying and other similar tasks.
A good portion of the icons/code/inspiration were taken from ss13 and as a result this is open source as well.
If you happen to own any of the icons used in this and you wish for them to be removed or they are not properly credited make an issue on our git about it or email me directly.

If you happen to enjoy our project please feel free to contribute to it at our git.
